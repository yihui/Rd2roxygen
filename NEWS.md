# CHANGES IN Rd2roxygen VERSION 1.15

- Conversion fails if function name contains a regex metacharacter (thanks, @joshuaulrich, #32).

# CHANGES IN Rd2roxygen VERSION 1.14

- Fixed a `parse_file()` error that can occur when `\keywords{}` is empty in `.Rd` (thanks, @byandell, #29).

# CHANGES IN Rd2roxygen VERSION 1.13

- Reduced one empty line in the examples sections generated by the roxygen tag `@examplesIf`.

# CHANGES IN Rd2roxygen VERSION 1.12

- Supports the roxygen tag `@examplesIf`.

# CHANGES IN Rd2roxygen VERSION 1.11

## MAJOR CHANGES

- when writing out the Rd file to document re-exported objects, the links are changed from `\link[pkg:name]{name}` to `\link[pkg:topic]{name}`, due to the recent requirement of CRAN that links should point to the topic instead of name

# CHANGES IN Rd2roxygen VERSION 1.10

## MINOR CHANGES

- `roxygen_and_build()` now calls `roxygen2::roxygenize()` in a new R session.

# CHANGES IN Rd2roxygen VERSION 1.9

## MINOR CHANGES

- `rab()` no longer reformats code in the usage sections of Rd files.

# CHANGES IN Rd2roxygen VERSION 1.8

## MINOR CHANGES

- No longer imports formatR in NAMESPACE (using formatR::tidy_source() now).

# CHANGES IN Rd2roxygen VERSION 1.7

## BUG FIXES

- importRd() fails due to a change in roxygen2 (https://github.com/klutometis/roxygen/issues/568).

# CHANGES IN Rd2roxygen VERSION 1.6.2

## MAJOR CHANGES

- the roxygen2 comments in Rd and NAMESPACE are no longer removed

# CHANGES IN Rd2roxygen VERSION 1.6.1

## MAJOR CHANGES

- existing tarballs of the source package will be deleted before building the new tarball with `rab()`

# CHANGES IN Rd2roxygen VERSION 1.6

## NEW FEATURES

- `rab(install = TRUE)` can automatically generate an Rd file for objects that are imported from other packages and later re-exported in the current package; this is done through the internal function `importRd()`

- when `build = FALSE` and `install = TRUE` in `rab()`, the package directory instead of the built tar ball is installed

- added an argument `install.opts` to `rab()` to specify options for `R CMD INSTALL` (default: `--with-keep.source` if `build = FALSE`, otherwise empty)

- added an argument `before` to `rab()` so we can evaluate an R expression before the package is roxygenized and built

- if the Examples section starts with a special token `# !formatR`, the example code will not be reformatted

- spaces will be added after commas in `\item{}`, e.g. `\item{x,y,z}{}` will be converted to `\item{x, y, z}{}`

# CHANGES IN Rd2roxygen VERSION 1.5

## MINOR CHANGES

- make sure the correct R executable is used (i.e. always use file.path(R.home('bin'), 'R'))

# CHANGES IN Rd2roxygen VERSION 1.4

## NEW FEATURES

- added a new argument 'build.opts' to rab() to pass options to R CMD build

## MAJOR CHANGES

- the new feature @returnItem introduced in Rd2roxygen 1.1 was temporarily removed, since it is not supported in roxygen2 (3.0.0) yet

# CHANGES IN Rd2roxygen VERSION 1.3

## MAJOR CHANGES

- Rd2roxygen depends on formatR v0.9 for better handling of example and usage code

# CHANGES IN Rd2roxygen VERSION 1.2

## NEW FEATURES

- added NULL to create_roxygen() when docType is data or package (#9)

- Rd2roxygen() tries to add the @export tags according to the exported names in the NAMESPACE (#10, #11 and #12)

- when reformatting usage and example sections, rab() tries to make code width smaller than 90, as required by R CMD check

## MINOR CHANGES

- the package vignette is built with knitr alone now (under R 3.0.x)

# CHANGES IN Rd2roxygen VERSION 1.1

## NEW FEATURES

- `\item{}` in the `\value{}` section will be formatted as the @returnItem tag, which is a new tag in roxygen2 (> 2.2.2) (#8) (thanks, Andreas Alfons)

- R code in `\dontrun{}`, `\dontshow{}` and `\donttest{}` can be reformatted by formatR now

## MINOR CHANGES

- the vignette is built with knitr via the Makefile; in previous versions, it was a fake Rnw document (essentially a weaved tex file)

- dependency on roxygen2 and formatR was changed to Imports

- default value for 'check.opts' in rab() is '--as-cran' now

# CHANGES IN Rd2roxygen VERSION 1.0-7

## NEW FEATURES

- @section is supported now: `\section{title}{content}` will be converted to `##' @section title: content` (thanks, Brian G. Peterson)

## MINOR CHANGES

- the package vignette now compiles with knitr instead of Sweave

# CHANGES IN Rd2roxygen VERSION 1.0-6

## BUG FIXES

- `\dontrun{}` can be correctly reformatted now; there was a bug in the previous version when options(replace.assign = TRUE)

# CHANGES IN Rd2roxygen VERSION 1.0-5

## NEW FEATURES

- usage for S3 methods like `\method{generic}{class}(param = value)` can be correctly reformatted now; in previous versions rab() will ignore such usage sections

# CHANGES IN Rd2roxygen VERSION 1.0-4

## NEW FEATURES

- Rd files that have `\docType{data}` or `\docType{package}` (for datasets and package documentation) are written into xxx-package.R directly; these names are not looked up in R scripts under the R directory of the source package

- Rd comments (following %) will be ignored when generating roxygen comments for arguments

# CHANGES IN Rd2roxygen VERSION 1.0-3

## NEW FEATURES

- a complete example of running Rd2roxygen() on a real package was added to ?Rd2roxygen

- re-run Rd2roxygen() on a package will remove the roxygen comments in R scripts before adding new roxygen comments parsed from Rd files; in old versions of this package, the old roxygen comments were not removed, hence the comments were added incrementally above the function objects, which was certainly not desirable

## MINOR CHANGES

- all these forms of quotes in assignments are allowed in Rd2roxygen(): `foo` <-, 'foo' <-, "foo" <-, and = can be used as the assigning operator as well

# CHANGES IN Rd2roxygen VERSION 1.0-2

## MAJOR CHANGES

- the usage sections in Rd files will be reformatted by default again when calling rab() (this feature was formerly removed in version 1.0-0)

## MINOR CHANGES

- rab(..., install = TRUE) will install the *.tar.gz file rather than the package directory; similarly, rab(..., check = TRUE) checks the tar ball as well

# CHANGES IN Rd2roxygen VERSION 1.0-1

## MINOR CHANGES

- the percent symbols in the examples code will be unescaped (i.e. `\%` becomes `%`) before the code is reformatted, then escaped again; this can avoid errors when reformatting the code, since `\%` is an illegal character in R

# CHANGES IN Rd2roxygen VERSION 1.0-0

## NEW FEATURES

- Rd2roxygen uses the brand-new roxygen2 rather than the old roxygen package which is no longer maintained; users are recommended to read the NEWS file of roxygen2 carefully. Some major changes include: the description is in the second *paragraph* rather than the second *line* now (i.e. there is an empty line between the title and description); @format and @source are supported, and a series of new tags are introduced in roxygen2 too

## MAJOR CHANGES

- the escape and use.Rd2 arguments are removed in rab() since roxygen2 can handle these cases elegantly

- roxygen.dir is the same as the package directory by default, so rab() will write all the documentations in the original package directory

- the usage section is no longer reformatted by formatR; roxygen2 formats it nicely

- the function rm_undocumented() is no longer needed, so it was removed from this package; use @noRd if you do not want the documentation of a certain object to be generated by roxygen2
