Description: Functions to convert Rd to roxygen documentation. It can
    parse an Rd file to a list, create the roxygen documentation and
    update the original R script (e.g. the one containing the
    definition of the function) accordingly. This package also provides
    utilities which can help developers build packages using roxygen more
    easily.
